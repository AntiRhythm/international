0:25Last time we saw things about gradients and directional
0:29derivatives. Before that we studied how to
0:32look for minima and maxima of functions of several variables.
0:37And today we are going to look again at min/max problems but in
0:41a different setting, namely, one for variables that
0:45are not independent. And so what we will see is you
0:49may have heard of Lagrange multipliers.
0:52And this is the one point in the term when I can shine with
0:59my French accent and say Lagrange's name properly.
1:05OK. What are Lagrange multipliers
1:08about? Well, the goal is to minimize
1:13or maximize a function of several variables.
1:19Let's say, for example, f of x, y, z,
1:22but where these variables are no longer independent.
1:41They are not independent. That means that there is a
1:43relation between them. The relation is maybe some
1:47equation of the form g of x, y, z equals some constant.
1:52You take the relation between x, y, z, you call that g and
1:57that gives you the constraint. And your goal is to minimize f
2:02only of those values of x, y, z that satisfy the
2:05constraint. What is one way to do that?
2:07Well, one to do that, if the constraint is very
2:10simple, we can maybe solve for one of the variables.
2:14Maybe we can solve this equation for one of the
2:17variables, plug it back into f, and then we have a usual
2:21min/max problem that we have seen how to do.
2:25The problem is sometimes you cannot actually solve for x,
2:28y, z in here because this condition is too complicated and
2:31then we need a new method. That is what we are going to do.
2:38Why would we care about that? Well, one example is actually
2:41in physics. Maybe you have seen in
2:43thermodynamics that you study quantities about gases,
2:47and those quantities that involve pressure,
2:50volume and temperature. And pressure,
2:53volume and temperature are not independent of each other.
2:56I mean you know probably the equation PV = NRT.
2:59And, of course, there you could actually solve
3:01to express things in terms of one or the other.
3:03But sometimes it is more convenient to keep all three
3:07variables but treat them as constrained.
3:09It is just an example of a situation where you might want
3:19to do this. Anyway, we will look mostly at
3:24particular examples, but just to point out that this
3:28is useful when you study guesses in physics.
3:32The first observation is we cannot use our usual method of
3:35looking for critical points of f.
3:36Because critical points of f typically will not satisfy this
3:40condition and so won't be good solutions.
3:43We need something else. Let's look at an example,
3:49and we will see how that leads us to the method.
3:53For example, let's say that I want to find
4:03the point closest to the origin -- -- on the hyperbola xy equals
4:173 in the plane. That means I have this
4:23hyperbola, and I am asking myself what is the point on it
4:26that is the closest to the origin?
4:29I mean we can solve this by elementary geometry,
4:31we don't need actually Lagrange multipliers,
4:34but we are going to do it with Lagrange multipliers because it
4:38is a pretty good example. What does it mean?
4:41Well, it means that we want to minimize distance to the origin.
4:47What is the distance to the origin?
4:49If I have a point, at coordinates (x,
4:53y) and then the distance to the origin is square root of x
4:58squared plus y squared. Well, do we really want to
5:02minimize that or can we minimize something easier?
5:05Yeah. Maybe we can minimize the
5:06square of a distance. Let's forget this guy and
5:14instead -- Actually, we will minimize f of x,
5:23y equals x squared plus y squared,
5:27that looks better, subject to the constraint xy =
5:393. And so we will call this thing
5:44g of x, y to illustrate the general method.
5:50Let's look at a picture. Here you can see in yellow the
5:58hyperbola xy equals three. And we are going to look for
6:02the points that are the closest to the origin.
6:05What can we do? Well, for example,
6:08we can plot the function x squared plus y squared,
6:13function f. That is the contour plot of f
6:17with a hyperbola on top of it. Now let's see what we can do
6:21with that. Well, let's ask ourselves,
6:25for example, if I look at points where f
6:30equals 20 now. I think I am at 20 but you
6:34cannot really see it. That is a circle with a point
6:37whose distant square is 20. Well, can I find a solution if
6:41I am on the hyperbola? Yes, there are four points at
6:44this distance. Can I do better?
6:46Well, let's decrease for distance.
6:49Yes, we can still find points on the hyperbola and so on.
6:52Except if we go too low then there are no points on this
6:56circle anymore in the hyperbola. If we decrease the value of f
7:00that we want to look at that will somehow limit value beyond
7:03which we cannot go, and that is the minimum of f.
7:07We are trying to look for the smallest value of f that will
7:13actually be realized on the hyperbola.
7:17When does that happen? Well, I have to backtrack a
7:20little bit. It seems like the limiting case
7:23is basically here. It is when the circle is
7:26tangent to the hyperbola. That is the smallest circle
7:31that will hit the hyperbola. If I take a larger value of f,
7:37I will have solutions. If I take a smaller value of f,
7:39I will not have any solutions anymore.
7:41So, that is the situation that we want to solve for.
7:49How do we find that minimum? Well, a key observation that is
7:54valid on this picture, and that actually remain true
7:58in the completely general case, is that when we have a minimum
8:03the level curve of f is actually tangent to our hyperbola.
8:09It is tangent to the set of points where x,
8:15y equals three, to the hyperbola.
8:20Let's write that down. We observe that at the minimum
8:32the level curve of f is tangent to the hyperbola.
8:49Remember, the hyperbola is given by the equal g equals
8:53three, so it is a level curve of g.
8:56We have a level curve of f and a level curve of g that are
8:59tangent to each other. And I claim that is going to be
9:03the general situation that we are interested in.
9:07How do we try to solve for points where this happens?
9:28How do we find x, y where the level curves of f
9:36and g are tangent to each other? Let's think for a second.
9:47If the two level curves are tangent to each other that means
9:51they have the same tangent line. That means that the normal
9:57vectors should be parallel. Let me maybe draw a picture
10:03here. This is the level curve maybe f
10:06equals something. And this is the level curve g
10:11equals constant. Here my constant is three.
10:16Well, if I look for gradient vectors, the gradient of f will
10:20be perpendicular to the level curve of f.
10:23The gradient of g will be perpendicular to the level curve
10:27of g. They don't have any reason to
10:29be of the same size, but they have to be parallel to
10:32each other. Of course, they could also be
10:35parallel pointing in opposite directions.
10:38But the key point is that when this happens the gradient of f
10:48is parallel to the gradient of g.
10:54Well, let's check that. Here is a point.
11:03And I can plot the gradient of f in blue.
11:05The gradient of g in yellow. And you see,
11:08in most of these places, somehow the two gradients are
11:12not really parallel. Actually, I should not be
11:14looking at random points. I should be looking only on the
11:17hyperbola. I want points on the hyperbola
11:19where the two gradients are parallel.
11:22Well, when does that happen? Well, it looks like it will
11:28happen here. When I am at a minimum,
11:31the two gradient vectors are parallel.
11:34It is not really proof. It is an example that seems to
11:37be convincing. So far things work pretty well.
11:43How do we decide if two vectors are parallel?
11:46Well, they are parallel when they are proportional to each
11:50other. You can write one of them as a
11:54constant times the other one, and that constant usually one
12:02uses the Greek letter lambda. I don't know if you have seen
12:07it before. It is the Greek letter for L.
12:10And probably, I am sure, it is somebody's
12:15idea of paying tribute to Lagrange by putting an L in
12:22there. Lambda is just a constant.
12:25And we are looking for a scalar lambda and points x and y where
12:31this holds. In fact,
12:33what we are doing is replacing min/max problems in two
12:37variables with a constraint between them by a set of
12:41equations involving, you will see, three variables.
12:47We had min/max with two variables x, y,
12:54but no independent. We had a constraint g of x,
13:00y equals constant. And that becomes something new.
13:06That becomes a system of equations where we have to
13:12solve, well, let's write down what it means for gradient f to
13:19be proportional to gradient g. That means that f sub x should
13:26be lambda times g sub x, and f sub y should be lambda
13:32times g sub y. Because the gradient vectors
13:36here are f sub x, f sub y and g sub x,
13:39g sub y. If you have a third variable z
13:43then you have also an equation f sub z equals lambda g sub z.
13:49Now, let's see. How many unknowns do we have in
13:53these equations? Well, there is x,
13:55there is y and there is lambda. We have three unknowns and have
14:01only two equations. Something is missing.
14:06Well, I mean x and y are not actually independent.
14:10They are related by the equation g of x,
14:14y equals c, so we need to add the constraint g equals c.
14:21And now we have three equations involving three variables.
14:26Let's see how that works. Here remember we have f equals
14:39x squared y squared and g = xy. What is f sub x?
14:45It is going to be 2x equals lambda times,
14:52what is g sub x, y.
14:55Maybe I should write here f sub x equals lambda g sub x just to
14:59remind you. Then we have f sub y equals
15:03lambda g sub y. F sub y is 2y equals lambda
15:10times g sub y is x. And then our third equation g
15:18equals c becomes xy equals three.
15:22So, that is what you would have to solve.
15:26Any questions at this point? No.
15:33Yes? How do I know the direction of
15:44a gradient? Do you mean how do I know that
15:47it is perpendicular to a level curve?
15:50Oh, how do I know if it points in that direction on the
15:54opposite one? Well, that depends.
15:56I mean we'd seen in last time, but the gradient is
15:59perpendicular to the level and points towards higher values of
16:02a function. So it could be -- Wait.
16:05What did I have? It could be that my gradient
16:08vectors up there actually point in opposite directions.
16:11It doesn't matter to me because it will still look the same in
16:15terms of the equation, just lambda will be positive or
16:18negative, depending on the case. I can handle both situations.
16:22It's not a problem. I can allow lambda to be
16:30positive or negative. Well, in this example,
16:34it looks like lambda will be positive.
16:35If you look at the picture on the plot.
16:38Yes? Well, because actually they are
16:48not equal to each other. If you look at this point where
16:51the hyperbola and the circle touch each other,
16:55first of all, I don't know which circle I am
16:58going to look at. I am trying to solve,
17:01actually, for the radius of the circle.
17:04I am trying to find what the minimum value of f is.
17:07And, second, at that point,
17:10the value of f and the value of g are not equal.
17:14g is equal to three because I want the hyperbola x equals
17:17three. The value of f will be the
17:19square of a distance, whatever that is.
17:22I think it will end up being 6, but we will see.
17:27So, you cannot really set them equal because you don't know
17:29what f is equal to in advance. Yes?
17:45Not quite. Actually, here I am just using
17:49this idea of finding a point closest to the origin to
17:52illustrate an example of a min/max problem.
17:55The general problem we are trying to solve is minimize f
17:59subject to g equals constant. And what we are going to do for
18:03that is we are really going to say instead let's look at places
18:07where gradient f and gradient g are parallel to each other and
18:10solve for equations of that. I think we completely lose the
18:14notion of closest point if we just look at these equations.
18:19We don't really say anything about closest points anymore.
18:21Of course, that is what they mean in the end.
18:24But, in the general setting, there is no closest point
18:28involved anymore. OK.
18:31Yes? Yes.
18:40It is always going to be the case that,
18:43at the minimum, or at the maximum of a function
18:46subject to a constraint, the level curves of f and the
18:49level curves of g will be tangent to each other.
18:52That is the basis for this method.
18:54I am going to justify that soon. It could be minimum or maximum.
19:00In three-dimensions it could even be a saddle point.
19:02And, in fact, I should say in advance,
19:03this method will not tell us whether it is a minimum or a
19:06maximum. We do not have any way of
19:08knowing, except for testing values.
19:10We cannot use second derivative tests or anything like that.
19:13I will get back to that. Yes?
19:21Yes. Here you can set y equals to
19:23favor x. Then you can minimize x squared
19:26plus nine over x squared. In general, if I am trying to
19:30solve a more complicated problem, I might not be able to
19:33solve. I am doing an example where,
19:35indeed, here you could solve and remove one variable,
19:38but you cannot always do that. And this method will still work.
19:41The other one won't. OK.
19:47I don't see any other questions. Are there any other questions?
19:53No. OK.
19:56I see a lot of students stretching and so on,
20:02so it is very confusing for me. How do we solve these equations?
20:08Well, the answer is in general we might be in deep trouble.
20:14There is no general method for solving the equations that you
20:18get from this method. You just have to think about
20:21them. Sometimes it will be very easy.
20:25Sometimes it will be so hard that you cannot actually do it
20:28without the computer. Sometimes it will be just hard
20:31enough to be on Part B of this week's problem set.
20:50I claim in this case we can actually do it without so much
20:56trouble, because actually we can think of this as a two by two
21:03linear system in x and y. Well, let me do something.
21:10Let me rewrite the first two equations as 2x - lambda y = 0.
21:18And lambda x - 2y = 0. And xy = 3.
21:30That is what we want to solve. Well, I can put this into
21:36matrix form. Two minus lambda,
21:41lambda minus two times x, y equals 0,0.
21:48Now, how do I solve a linear system matrix times x,
21:52y equals zero? Well, I always have an obvious
21:54solution. X and y both equal to zero.
21:56Is that a good solution? No, because zero times zero is
22:02not three. We want another solution,
22:07the trivial solution. 0,0 does not solve the
22:14constraint equation xy equals three, so we want another
22:20solution. When do we have another
22:24solution? Well, when the determinant of a
22:29matrix is zero. We have other solutions that
22:37exist only if determinant of a matrix is zero.
22:46M is this guy. Let's compute the determinant.
23:01Well, that seems to be negative four plus lambda squared.
23:08That is zero exactly when lambda squared equals four,
23:15which is lambda is plus or minus two.
23:20Already you see here it is a the level of difficulty that is
23:25a little bit much for an exam but perfectly fine for a problem
23:30set or for a beautiful lecture like this one.
23:33How do we deal with -- Well, we have two cases to look at.
23:37Lambda equals two or lambda equals minus two.
23:40Let's start with lambda equals two.
23:43If I set lambda equals two, what does this equation become?
23:47Well, it becomes x equals y. This one becomes y equals x.
23:53Well, they seem to be the same. x equals y.
23:57And then the equation xy equals three becomes,
24:01well, x squared equals three. I have two solutions.
24:06One is x equals root three and, therefore, y equals root three
24:15as well, or negative root three and negative root three.
24:23Let's look at the other case. If I set lambda equal to
24:26negative two then I get 2x equals negative 2y.
24:30That means x equals negative y. The second one,
24:372y equals negative 2x. That is y equals negative x.
24:40Well, that is the same thing. And xy equals three becomes
24:45negative x squared equals three. Can we solve that?
24:51No. There are no solutions here.
24:58Now we have two candidate points which are these two
25:03points, root three, root three or negative root
25:07three, negative root three. OK.
25:13Let's actually look at what we have here.
25:16Maybe you cannot read the coordinates, but the point that
25:20I have here is indeed root three, root three.
25:23How do we see that lambda equals two?
25:26Well, if you look at this picture, the gradient of f,
25:29that is the blue vector, is indeed twice the yellow
25:32vector, gradient g. That is where you read the
25:36value of lambda. And we have the other solution
25:41which is somewhere here. Negative root three,
25:45negative root there. And there, again,
25:48lambda equals two. The two vectors are
25:51proportional by a factor of two. Yes?
25:59No, solutions are not quite guaranteed to be absolute minima
26:01or maxima. They are guaranteed to be
26:03somehow critical points end of a constraint.
26:06That means if you were able to solve and eliminate the variable
26:09that would be a critical point. When you have the same problem,
26:12as we have critical points, are they maxima or minima?
26:14And the answer is, well, we won't know until we
26:22check. More questions?
26:28No. Yes?
26:32What is a Lagrange multiplier? Well, it is this number lambda
26:36that is called the multiplier here.
26:39It is a multiplier because it is what you have to multiply
26:44gradient of g by to get gradient of f.
26:48It multiplies.
27:04Let's try to see why is this method valid?
27:11Because so far I have shown you pictures and have said see they
27:18are tangent. But why is it that they have to
27:23be tangent in general? Let's think about it.
27:28Let's say that we are at constrained min or max.
27:37What that means is that if I move on the level g equals
27:42constant then the value of f should only increase or only
27:46decrease. But it means,
27:49in particular, to first order it will not
27:53change. At an unconstrained min or max,
27:56partial derivatives are zero. In this case,
27:59derivatives are zero only in the allowed directions.
28:02And the allowed directions are those that stay on the levels of
28:09this g equals constant. In any direction along the
28:21level set g = c the rate of change of f must be zero.
28:40That is what happens at minima or maxima.
28:44Except here, of course, we look only at the
28:49allowed directions. Let's say the same thing in
28:54terms of directional derivatives.
29:23That means for any direction that is tangent to the
29:35constraint level g equal c, we must have df over ds in the
29:49direction of u equals zero. I will draw a picture.
30:00Let's say now I am in three variables just to give you
30:05different examples. Here I have a level surface g
30:09equals c. I am at my point.
30:11And if I move in any direction that is on the level surface,
30:18so I move in the direction u tangent to the level surface,
30:24then the rate of change of f in that direction should be zero.
30:32Now, remember what the formula is for this guy.
30:34Well, we have seen that this guy is actually radiant f dot u.
30:44That means any such vector u must be perpendicular to the
30:58gradient of f. That means that the gradient of
31:05f should be perpendicular to anything that is tangent to this
31:10level. That means the gradient of f
31:12should be perpendicular to the level set.
31:16That is what we have shown.
31:37But we know another vector that is also perpendicular to the
31:40level set of g. That is the gradient of g.
31:57We conclude that the gradient of f must be parallel to the
32:02gradient of g because both are perpendicular to the level set
32:07of g. I see confused faces,
32:09so let me try to tell you again where that comes from.
32:13We said if we had a constrained minimum or maximum,
32:16if we move in the level set of g, f doesn't change.
32:19Well, it doesn't change to first order.
32:20It is the same idea as when you are looking for a minimum you
32:24set the derivative equal to zero.
32:26So the derivative in any direction, tangent to g equals
32:31c, should be the directional derivative of f,
32:34in any such direction, should be zero.
32:38That is what we mean by critical point of f.
32:43And so that means that any vector u, any unit vector
32:48tangent to the level set of g is going to be perpendicular to the
32:55gradient of f. That means that the gradient of
33:00f is perpendicular to the level set of g.
33:04If you want, that means the level sets of f
33:06and g are tangent to each other. That is justifying what we have
33:10observed in the picture that the two level sets have to be
33:15tangent to each other at the prime minimum or maximum.
33:20Does that make a little bit of sense?
33:23Kind of. I see at least a few faces
33:28nodding so I take that to be a positive answer.
33:35Since I have been asked by several of you,
33:39how do I know if it is a maximum or a minimum?
33:43Well, warning, the method doesn't tell whether
33:57a solution is a minimum or a maximum.
34:09How do we do it? Well, more bad news.
34:13We cannot use the second derivative test.
34:26And the reason for that is that we care actually only about
34:30these specific directions that are tangent to variable of g.
34:34And we don't want to bother to try to define directional second
34:39derivatives. Not to mention that actually it
34:42wouldn't work. There is a criterion but it is
34:45much more complicated than that. Basically, the answer for us is
34:49that we don't have a second derivative test in this
34:52situation. What are we left with?
34:54Well, we are just left with comparing values.
34:57Say that in this problem you found a point where f equals
35:00three, a point where f equals nine, a point where f equals 15.
35:04Well, then probably the minimum is the point where f equals
35:08three and the maximum is 15. Actually, in this case,
35:12where we found minima, these two points are tied for
35:17minimum. What about the maximum?
35:19What is the maximum of f on the hyperbola?
35:22Well, it is infinity because the point can go as far as you
35:25want from the origin. But the general idea is if we
35:29have a good reason to believe that there should be a minimum,
35:35and it's not like at infinity or something weird like that,
35:38then the minimum will be a solution of the Lagrange
35:42multiplier equations. We just look for all the
35:46solutions and then we choose the one that gives us the lowest
35:51value. Is that good enough?
35:55Let me actually write that down.
36:23To find the minimum or the maximum, we compare values of f
36:35at the various solutions -- -- to Lagrange multiplier
36:46equations.
37:08I should say also that sometimes you can just conclude
37:11by thinking geometrically. In this case,
37:14when it is asking you which point is closest to the origin
37:18you can just see that your answer is the correct one.
37:23Let's do an advanced example. Advanced means that -- Well,
37:32this one I didn't actually dare to put on top of the other
37:37problem sets. Instead, I am going to do it.
37:48What is this going to be about? We are going to look for a
37:51surface minimizing pyramid. Let's say that we want to build
38:03a pyramid with a given triangular base -- -- and a
38:19given volume. Say that I have maybe in the x,
38:28y plane I am giving you some triangle.
38:33And I am going to try to build a pyramid.
38:40Of course, I can choose where to put the top of a pyramid.
38:48This guy will end up being behind now.
38:53And the constraint and the goal is to minimize the total surface
39:09area. The first time I taught this
39:13class, it was a few years ago, was just before they built the
39:15Stata Center. And then I used to motivate
39:17this problem by saying Frank Gehry has gone crazy and has
39:20been given a triangular plot of land he wants to put a pyramid.
39:23There needs to be the right amount of volume so that you can
39:26put all the offices in there. And he wants it to be,
39:28actually, covered in solid gold.
39:31And because that is expensive, the administration wants him to
39:34cut the costs a bit. And so you have to minimize the
39:38total size so that it doesn't cost too much.
39:42We will see if MIT comes up with a triangular pyramid
39:45building. Hopefully not.
39:48It could be our next dorm, you never know.
39:58Anyway, it is a fine geometry problem.
40:01Let's try to think about how we can do this.
40:07The natural way to think about it would be -- Well,
40:10what do we have to look for first?
40:11We have to look for the position of that top point.
40:18Remember we know that the volume of a pyramid is one-third
40:29the area of base times height. In fact, fixing the volume,
40:37knowing that we have fixed the area of a base,
40:39means that we are fixing the height of the pyramid.
40:43The height is completely fixed. What we have to choose just is
40:47where do we put that top point? Do we put it smack in the
40:52middle of a triangle or to a side or even anywhere we want?
40:58Its z coordinate is fixed. Let's call h the height.
41:15What we could do is something like this.
41:20We say we have three points of a base.
41:24Let's call them p1 at (x1, y1,0); p2 at (x2,
41:32y2,0); p3 at (x3, y3,0).
41:36This point p is the unknown point at (x, y,
41:40h). We know the height.
41:42And then we want to minimize the sum of the areas of these
41:46three triangles. One here, one here and one at
41:50the back. And areas of triangles we know
41:53how to express by using length of cross-product.
41:57It becomes a function of x and y.
42:00And you can try to minimize it. Actually, it doesn't quite work.
42:04The formulas are just too complicated.
42:05You will never get there. What happens is actually maybe
42:14we need better coordinates. Why do we need better
42:18coordinates? That is because the geometry is
42:21kind of difficult to do if you use x, y coordinates.
42:24I mean formula for cross-product is fine,
42:28but then the length of the vector will be annoying and just
42:33doesn't look good. Instead, let's think about it
42:37differently.
42:54I claim if we do it this way and we express the area as a
43:01function of x, y, well, actually we can't
43:06solve for a minimum. Here is another way to do it.
43:13Well, what has worked pretty well for us so far is this
43:17geometric idea of base times height.
43:19So let's think in terms of the heights of side triangles.
43:29I am going to use the height of these things.
43:37And I am going to say that the area will be the sum of three
43:43terms, which are three bases times three heights.
43:48Let's give names to these quantities.
43:53Actually, for that it is going to be good to have the point in
43:58the xy plane that lives directly below p.
44:01Let's call it q. P is the point that coordinates
44:08x, y, h. And let's call q the point that
44:13is just below it and so it' coordinates are x,
44:19y, 0. Let's see.
44:22Let me draw a map of this thing. p1, p2, p3 and I have my point
44:34q in the middle. Let's see.
44:37To know these areas, I need to know the base.
44:40Well, the base I can decide that I know it because it is
44:44part of my given data. I know the sides of this
44:48triangle. Let me call the lengths a1,
44:53a2, a3. I also need to know the height,
44:56so I need to know these lengths.
44:58How do I know these lengths? Well, its distance in space,
45:01but it is a little bit annoying.
45:03But maybe I can reduce it to a distance in the plane by looking
45:10instead at this distance here. Let me give names to the
45:17distances from q to the sides. Let's call u1,
45:24u2, u3 the distances from q to the sides.
45:47Well, now I can claim I can find, actually,
45:49sorry. I need to draw one more thing.
45:53I claim I have a nice formula for the area,
45:57because this is vertical and this is horizontal so this
46:01length here is u3, this length here is h.
46:05So what is this length here? It is the square root of u3
46:13squared plus h squared. And similarly for these other
46:17guys. They are square roots of a u
46:23squared plus h squared. The heights of the faces are
46:31square root of u1 squared times h squared.
46:36And similarly with u2 and u3. So the total side area is going
46:43to be the area of the first faces,
46:47one-half of base times height, plus one-half of a base times a
46:58height plus one-half of the third one.
47:06It doesn't look so much better. But, trust me,
47:09it will get better. Now, that is a function of
47:15three variables, u1, u2, u3.
47:19And how do we relate u1, u2, u3 to each other?
47:22They are probably not independent.
47:25Well, let's cut this triangle here into three pieces like
47:32that. Then each piece has side --
47:35Well, let's look at it the piece of the bottom.
47:40It has base a3, height u3. Cutting base into three tells
47:50you that the area of a base is one-half of a1,
47:57u1 plus one-half of a2, u2 plus one-half of a3,
48:04u3. And that is our constraint.
48:09My three variables, u1, u2, u3, are constrained in
48:12this way. The sum of this figure must be
48:14the area of a base. And I want to minimize that guy.
48:17So that is my g and that guy here is my f.
48:23Now we try to apply our Lagrange multiplier equations.
48:28Well, partial f of a partial u1 is -- Well,
48:33if you do the calculation, you will see it is one-half a1,
48:36u1 over square root of u1^2 plus h^2 equals lambda,
48:43what is partial g, partial a1?
48:46That one you can do, I am sure. It is one-half a1.
48:50Oh, these guys simplify. If you do the same with the
49:00second one -- -- things simplify again.
49:09And the same with the third one. Well, you will get,
49:17after simplifying, u3 over square root of u3
49:21squared plus h squared equals lambda.
49:24Now, that means this guy equals this guy equals this guy.
49:27They are all equal to lambda. And, if you think about it,
49:33that means that u1 = u2 = u3. See, it looked like scary
49:39equations but the solution is very simple.
49:42What does it mean? It means that our point q
49:45should be equidistant from all three sides.
49:47That is called the incenter. Q should be in the incenter.
49:52The next time you have to build a golden pyramid and don't want
49:56to go broke, well, you know where to put the top.
49:59If that was a bit fast, sorry. Anyway, it is not completely
50:03crucial. But go over it and you will see
50:06it works. Have a nice weekend.
